# PDFDataExtraction

This application extracts data from customer-filled PDF forms and converts the extracted data into Excel or CSV format. It is designed to accurately capture various types of customer and shop details, including those indicated by tick marks, cross marks, or shaded boxes.  The solution leverages AI/ML techniques to ensure precise information extraction.

## Project Overview

Many businesses rely on PDF forms for data collection. Manually extracting this data can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates this process, significantly improving efficiency and data accuracy.  It addresses the challenge of handling different form field types, including checkboxes, radio buttons (represented by tick/cross marks), and shaded boxes, which traditional PDF parsing methods often struggle with.

## Features

* **PDF Form Processing:**  Handles various PDF form structures and field types.
* **Accurate Data Extraction:** Employs AI/ML models to precisely identify and extract information, even from tick marks, cross marks, and shaded boxes.
* **Data Conversion:** Converts the extracted data into user-friendly Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) formats.
* **Customizable:**  The application can be adapted to different PDF form layouts with minimal code changes. *(Explain how this is achieved, e.g., configuration files, training data, etc.)*
* **User-Friendly Interface:** *(If applicable, describe the user interface and how to use the application.)*

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python *(Or the language you used)*
* **PDF Processing Libraries:**  PyPDF2, PDFMiner, or other relevant libraries. *(List the specific libraries)*
* **AI/ML Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenCV, or other relevant libraries. *(List the specific libraries and explain their role, e.g., for image processing, OCR, etc.)*
* **Data Processing Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy.
* **Excel/CSV Libraries:** Openpyxl, csv.
* **Other Dependencies:** *(List any other dependencies, e.g., specific OCR engines like Tesseract)*

## Setup and Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` *(Create a requirements.txt file listing all the project dependencies)*
    * *(If using Tesseract OCR, install it on your system and configure the path.)*

2. **Installation:**
    * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PDF_Data_Extraction.git`
    * Navigate to the project directory: `cd PDF_Data_Extraction`

3. **Configuration:**
    * *(Explain how to configure the application, e.g., paths to PDF files, output file names, configuration files for field mapping, training data paths, etc.)*  Provide examples of configuration files if used.

## Usage

1. **Running the Application:**
    * *(Provide clear instructions on how to run the application, including command-line arguments or GUI instructions.)*  For example: `python extract_data.py -i input.pdf -o output.xlsx`

2. **Input PDF Format:**
    * *(Describe the expected format of the input PDF forms.  Provide examples if possible.  Mention if there are any specific requirements for the forms.)*

3. **Output Format:**
    * The extracted data will be saved in the specified Excel or CSV file. *(Describe the structure of the output file, including column names and data types.)*

## Future Enhancements

* *(List potential future improvements, such as:)*
    * Support for more complex form layouts.
    * Improved accuracy for low-quality scans.
    * Integration with other data processing tools.
    * Web-based user interface.
